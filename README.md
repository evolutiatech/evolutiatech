### 1. Neural Network Principles and Applications

â€¢ Summation;

â€¢ Calculating Activation;

â€¢ Activation Functions;

â€¢ Bias Neurons.

Seeing how this simple neural network is calculated will form the foundation for understanding training, and other more complex features of neural networks.

### 1.1 Understanding the Summation Operator

### â€¢ Summation Operator reduced to pseudocode 

<p align="justify">
In this section, we will take a quick look at the summation operator. The summation operator, represented by the capital Greek letter sigma can be seen in Equation Below. The above equation is a summation. If you are unfamiliar with sigma notation, it is essentially the same thing as a programming for loop.
</p>

<img width="1145" height="355" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b713cdf-c3d1-4920-bd87-da7b78542d06" />

```c
pseudocode

Initialize sum to 0
For i from 1 to 10 do
    sum = sum + (2 * i)
End For
Return sum
```
<p align="justify">  
As you can see, the summation operator is very similar to a for loop. The information just below the sigma symbol species the stating value and the indexing variable. The information above the sigma species the limit of the loop. The information to the right of sigma specifies the value that is being summed.
</p>

### â€¢ ANSI C89/90 Multiparadigms

```c
#include <stdio.h>

/* Function to compute the sum based on the pseudocode */
int compute_sum();

int main() {
    int result;

    result = compute_sum();
    printf("The sum is: %d\n", result);

    return 0;
}

/* Implementation of the sum calculation */
int compute_sum() {
    int i;
    int sum = 0; /* Initialize sum to 0 */

    for (i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
        sum = sum + (2 * i); /* sum = sum + (2 * i) */
    }

    return sum; /* Return the computed sum */
}

```

### 1.2. Calculating a Neural Network

<p align="justify">
We will begin by looking at how a neural network calculates its output. You should already know the structure of a neural network from the bookâ€™s introduction. Consider a neural network such as the one in below:
</p>

<img width="1141" height="439" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9221248e-ee25-4c78-8eb6-a2e3c9547cc0" />

<p align="justify">
This neural network has one output neuron. As a result, it will have one output value. To calculate the value of this output neuron (O1), we must calculate the activation for each of the inputs into O1. The inputs that feed into O1 are H1, H2 and B2. The activation for B2 is simply 1.0, because it is a bias neuron. However, H1 and H2 must be calculated independently. To calculate H1 and H2, the activations of I1, I2 and B1 must be considered. Though H1 and H2 share the same inputs, they will not calculate to the same activation. This is because they have different weights. The weights are represented by lines in the above diagram.
</p>

<p align="justify">
First we must look at how one activation calculation is done. This same activation calculation can then be applied to the other activation calculations. We will examine how H1 is calculated. Figure Below shows only the inputs to H1.
</p>

<img width="1148" height="330" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b443d725-0297-4338-803d-34030824507e" />


<p align="justify">
We will now see how to calculate H1. This relatively simple equation is shown in Equation below.
</p>

<p align="justify">
To understand Equation 1.2 we first examine the variables that go into it. For the above equation we have three input values, given by the variable i. The three input values are input values of I1, I2 and B1. I1 and I2 are simply the input values that the neural network was provided to compute the output. B1 is always 1, because it is the bias neuron.
</p>

<p align="justify">
There are also three weight values considered w1, w2 and w3. These are the weighted connections between H1 and the previous layer. Therefore, the variables to this equation are:
</p>
